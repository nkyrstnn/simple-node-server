<p>I went to Regional Science High School and I am now currently enrolled at the University of the Philippines Los Banos. I believe in the saying <em><q>Courage is not the absence of fear rather the judgement that something is much more
important than fear.The Brave man may not live forever but the cautious man will not live at all</q></em>.
