        <h1>My Journey</h1>
        <p><a href="http://w3schools.com"><img src="images/baby.jpg" alt="hehe" width="100px" height="100px"/></a>Disclaimer:This picture is not me. This picture is included here to help you picture what a baby looks like. <br><br> I was born November 1 1995 (scary) to a Taiwanses father and a Filipino mother. My childhood was normal enough(I dont have anyone to compare it to), I loved to play and apparently I was a bald baby (My mom loved cutting my hair like a boy). Chinese eyes on a bald baby, you don't know how many shaolin jokes I had endured over the course of my childhood. That's about it</p>
        <p>I went to Regional Science High School where I made a lot of friends. <a href="text-formatting-1.html"><img src="images/high-school.jpg" alt="RSHSIII" width="150px" height="100px"></a>, they all go to diffirent colleges now but we meet from time to time when I go back home. The four years of my high school was fun and educational. Loved it</p>
        <p>This is what I look like now <a href="images-1.html"><img src="images/me.jpg" alt="current" width="150px" height="150px"></a>, my life is going great. College life is treating me good though its a bit stressful sometimes, balancing orgs and academics is a full time job lol.</p>
        <p><a href="http://google.com"><img src="images/future.jpg" alt="future" width="150px" height="100px"></a> In the future, I plan to be super rich and not have to worry about anything or get bitten by a vampire, whichever comes first.</p>
